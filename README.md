# LMASD-G
LMASD-G is a multimodal model (CLIP + text→vision cross-attention) for face-independent gender recognition at long range and oblique/nadir views. It exploits seven soft biometrics—beard, moustache, hairstyle, upper, lower, feet, accessories. On U-DetAGReID it beats baselines, stays reliable to 120 m, and yields interpretable, attribute-level maps.
